# NBA Championship Predictor
This is an nba championship predictor that uses data from the nba_api as well as data from webscraping basketball reference.

## Getting Started
To run this file requires Python 3.7+ along with the requests and numpy packages. In addition, it is necessary to have the imblearn and nba_api packages. The install commands for these packages are at the top of the file as a comment.

## Running Yourself
Running the final simulation takes a couple hours, so don't think it is not working if it runs for a while. Also, when scraping data from basketball-reference if you try running the code for it too many times in a small period of time you will get an error and will have to wait a little bit to try again, so once you load in the data try not to run it again.

## Continuous Updating
I am trying to continuously work on the models I have created here and use more data that is more useful. If you have any suggestions, please let me know because I am just trying to learn.
